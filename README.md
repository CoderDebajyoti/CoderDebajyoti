Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a student, passionate about Robotics with AI. I love working on exciting projects and learning new technologies.

## üî≠ Projects & Work

- **[Palindrome Number Checker](https://github.com/CoderDebajyoti/Palindrome-Number-Checker-)**: The Palindrome Number Checker is a web-based application designed to determine if a given number is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward, such as 121 or 1331. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a simple and interactive user interface for users to check numbers for palindromicity. Users can input a number, and with a click of a button, the application will instantly display whether the number is a palindrome. This project demonstrates basic web development skills, including user input handling, DOM manipulation, and conditional logic in JavaScript.
- **[Smart Plant Monitoring System]()**: This project will show some applied technology on indoor plants, such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, water level, etc., and our focus is to make it automated planting using Arduino.
- **[Portfolio](https://sites.google.com/view/debajyotidas/project-page)**: Creating a portfolio website involves designing and developing a personal web space to showcase your work, skills, and achievements. This type of website serves as a digital resume, allowing you to present your projects, experiences, and talents to potential employers, clients, or collaborators.
